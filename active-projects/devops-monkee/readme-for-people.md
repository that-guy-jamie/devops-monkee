## 🙏 Acknowledgments & Origins

**DevOps Monkee** formalizes governance practices originally developed across multiple projects including:

- **[ASTRO - the Association of Short-Term Rental Owners](https://theastro.org)**: WordPress-based membership platform
- **Audit Monkee**: AI-powered auditing and compliance framework
- **Ads Monkee**: Advertising automation and optimization platform
- **Local Call Generator**: Lead generation and call routing system

The SBEP Protocol was born from real-world operational challenges faced during the development of these systems, including AI agent coordination, version management, quality assurance, and deployment safety.

**Special thanks to these pioneering projects for establishing the governance patterns that became the foundation of SBEP.**
