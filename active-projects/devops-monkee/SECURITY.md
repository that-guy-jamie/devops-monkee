# Security Policy

We take the security of DevOps Monkee seriously. If you believe you've found a vulnerability, please follow the steps below.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest minor within the current major (e.g., `1.x`). Security fixes will be released as patch versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Do not** open a public issue.
- Email: **jamie@oneclick.agency**
- Include: affected version(s), OS, reproduction steps, impact, and any PoC you can share safely.

We aim to acknowledge within **72 hours** and provide a remediation plan or status update within **7 days**.

## Coordinated Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. Once a fix is available on npm, we'll publish release notes crediting reporters (opt-in) and describing the impact and mitigation.

## Safe Harbor

Good-faith security research that follows this policy won't be considered a violation. Please avoid accessing data that isn't yours, and limit testing to your own environments.
