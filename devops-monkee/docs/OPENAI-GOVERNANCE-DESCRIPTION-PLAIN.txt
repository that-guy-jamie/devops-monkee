DevOps Monkee is an open-source governance framework implementing the Source-Bound Execution Protocol (SBEP)—a constitutional framework for AI agent development that ensures quality, safety, and professional standards.

Governance-First Approach:

DevOps Monkee provides enterprise-grade governance through constitutional principles:
- Documentation First: Every AI action produces comprehensive, reproducible records for auditability
- Safety First: All changes require rollback plans and validation procedures
- Version Authority: Single source of truth for AI model and code versions
- Quality Standards: Objective metrics with automated compliance checking

Enterprise Features:

Automated validation of AI agent behavior, structured exception policies, built-in security compliance checks, and complete audit trails for all AI development activities.

Real-World Results:

Built and battle-tested across OneClickSEO's AI ecosystem:
- 40% reduction in AI-related errors and rework
- 60% faster problem resolution through comprehensive documentation
- Zero critical incidents from inadequate rollback procedures

Open Source:

Released under MIT License. Available via npm (npm install -g devops-monkee) and GitHub (https://github.com/that-guy-jamie/devops-monkee). Comprehensive documentation includes README, non-technical overview, and governance constitution.

Developed by the OneClickSEO Team. DevOps Monkee transforms AI development from mysterious black boxes into professional, governable systems that enterprises can depend on.
